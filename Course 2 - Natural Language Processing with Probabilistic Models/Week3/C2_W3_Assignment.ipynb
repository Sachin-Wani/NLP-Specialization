    "# Language Models: Auto-Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build an auto-complete system.\n",
    "Auto-complete system is something you might be seeing every day: When you google something, you often have suggestions to help you complete your search. When you are writing an email, you get suggestions telling you possible endings to your sentence.  By the end of this assignment, you will develop a proto-type of such system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"stanford.png\" style=\"width:700px;height:300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A key building block for an auto-complete system is language models.\n",
    "A Language models assigns the probability to a sequence of words, in a way that more \"likely\" sequences receives higher scores.  For example, \"I have a pen\" is expected to have a higher probability than \"I am a pen\", since tha first one seems to be a more natural sentence in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of this probability calculation to develop an suto-complete system.  Suppose the user typed \"I eat scrambled\" already.  Then we find a word `x`  such that \"I eat scrambled x\" receives the highest probability.  Perhaps \"egg\" would be a natural word to come.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While a variety of language models have been developed, this assignment uses **N-grams**, a simple but still powerful methodology for language modeling.\n",
    "N-grams are used not only for auto-complete systems, but are also useful in machine translation, speech recognition, and could even help you classify authors given a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the steps of this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess data\n",
    "    - Load and tokenize data.\n",
    "    - Split the sentences into training and test sets.\n",
    "    - Replace words with a low frequency by an unknown marker '<unk>'.\n",
    "1. Develop N-gram based language models\n",
    "    - Compute the count of n-grams from a given data set.\n",
    "    - Estimate the conditional probability of a next word with k-smoothing.\n",
    "1. Evaluate the N-gram models by computing the perplexity score.\n",
    "1. Use your own model to suggest an upcoming word given your sentence. "

All the other words that are not part of your closed vocabulary will be changed to the word 'unk'. You will now create a function that takes in a text document, n, which is the number of most frequent words used that you want to keep, returns the document containing only the word closed vocabulary and the word unk.
