So it seems more that what we do is to use word embeddings (one-hot vectors) to predict target words? I did not want to modify this because maybe it is my own misunderstanding.\n",
    "* Also, in the first paragraphs it is mentioned that we will use 'slightly pre-trained vectors', but it did not see these, since the ANN is initialized by randomization. \n",
    "* Some comments are needed on the regularization parameter C.\n",
    "* Why do the word embeddings come given by: embs = (W1.T + W2)/2.0. I don't think there is any explanation about it in the video lectures or in the assignment. I did not fix this because I do not understand it myself. My belief was that word embeddings are the vector representations of the words. But from the beginning of the assignment we assumed that these are one-hot encodings. What does it mean to do the average of two layers in an ANN?"

    "# Assignment 4: Word Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth programming assignment of Course 2. In this assignment we will show you how to compute the word embeddings. In Natural Language Processing (NLP) we can not only rely on counting the number of positive words and negative words, as we did in the last course using logistic regression. Instead we will try to find a way to represent each word by a vector. The vector could then represent syntactic (i.e. parts of speech) and semantic (i.e. meaning) structures. In this assignment you will explore a classic way of learning embeddings, or representations, of words by using a famous model called the continuous bag of words (CBOW) model. By completing this assignment you will:\n",

    "Because it will take a while to train your CBOW model, you will code the model and make sure to get the expected outputs. We will give you some slightly pre-trained vectors and then you will fine tune them on the Shakespeare dataset. \n",
